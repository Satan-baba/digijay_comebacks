# digijay_comebacks
Leveraging MACHINE LEARING to predict digvijay's (one of my close friend) comeback to certain messages. Need more data to improve the accuracy of the LSTM model. 
You can add comebacks to the dig_comebacks.txt file with comebacks in the following form:
"message1 - comeback to the message1 . message2 - comeback to the message2 . "
(Do not include quotes. It was added to indicate the space at the end of the message after the fullstop)
